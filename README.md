# ALGAE-SCRAPER-COVER-FAB-FILES
FABRICATION FILES FOR STAINLESS STEEL WAND STYLE RAZOR ALGAE SCRAPER COVER/MOUNT


Check the images to confirm the style of algae scraper I use. Parasolid included if you wish to remix.

I prefer to use a stainless steel algae scraper in my nano planted tank. The particular style consists of a standard 
square razor blade mounted between an angled plate and a retention insert.

For safe storage I designed a protective cover that retains the scraper vertically, securing the blade to prevent 
accidental contact. To release, pick the blade upward and outward to unseat from the two angled tabs located 
towards the bottom. The rear features a recess for typical double-sided tape, 3/4" (19.05mm) wide and 1" (25.4mm) long.
